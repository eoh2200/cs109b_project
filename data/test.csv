Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.

Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not.
Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?
Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though.
Nancy: How about u, Vic?
Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.
Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. 
Vic: What do u mean?
Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.
Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.
Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.
Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?
Vic: I do. 
Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. 
Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.
Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. 
Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram!
Phil: So, what else?
Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)
Phil: And does this motivate u to train?
Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. 
Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr?
Phil: What?
Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account.
Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u!

Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?
Noah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!

Zach: Girl, it's the best place to work in! A lot of my friends started as software testers and they are really satisfied. Good money and no rat race.

Zach: You don't have to. If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. It's not that difficult, really. You should give it a try. Tech is our future.
Rael: Hmm... Maybe you're right. I'm still not sure what to do with my career, so... why not.
Zach: If you want, I can talk to my friends and they will give you some advice on how to start, what courses to choose and so on.
Rael: That would be great, thanks.

Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls...

Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)

695,13731166,Betty's house has mould due to condensation. Andy will send her a quote for the work needed by Friday.,"Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. 
Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?
Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. 
Betty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!
Andy: No problem, speak soon."

Kai: Would you like to leave London?
Michael: yes asap
Kai: for the Netherlands?
Michael: maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don't want to stay there. I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative
Kai: depends on the field. I don't know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also
Michael: true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? too much work?
Kai: yes, I basically never rest these days
Michael: that’s not good, you need rest to avoid a burnout, which I had just before I went on holiday
Kai: Probably, I have a conference 8th of Dec, then I'll rest a bit, I hope."

Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy.
Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P
Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.
Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.
Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?
Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.

Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm

#Person2#: I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let's say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?

If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment!
#Person2#: It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.

#Person2#: Yeah! I just started my training today and I'm not really sure where to begin. 
#Person1#: It's ok, I know how it is. This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps. Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition? 
#Person2#: Well, I don't want to be ripped like you! I just want a good physique with weights and cardio. 
#Person1#: In that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets. Five kilo weights should be enough. Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle. 
#Person2#: Got it! Wow is that the weight you are lifting? My goodness that's a lot of weight!

#Person2#: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. 
#Person1#: Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? 
#Person2#: OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. 
#Person1#: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. 
#Person2#: That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI/SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. 
#Person1#: Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes,one at a state level and one at a federal level? 
#Person2#: That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. 
#Person1#: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. 
#Person2#: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.
#Person2#: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.

He told them some interesting stories of Edinburgh and really made the history of the Edinburgh castle come alive.

#Person1#: Yes. In fact, it's considered one of the best hotels in Beijing. You'll get very good service here.
#Person2#: I think so.
#Person1#: Please take a look at the itinerary we prepared for you, and let me know if there's any problem.
#Person2#: Thank you."
7,hiddentest_7,,"#Person1#: What do you usually do at night?
#Person2#: The same as in America. Going to a beer house, drinking, chatting and dancing disco. Sometimes I dance ballroom and sing karaoke with friends.
#Person1#: My father used to work in China for some years. He often complained that he couldn't find a place for fun in the evening. Most people stayed at home and very few could be seen walking on the street at nine or ten o'clock.
#Person2#: Now it's quite different. Night life is very much enriched. It's very common for young people to enjoy themselves even overnight.
#Person1#: En. How about another Martini?
#Person2#: OK."
8,hiddentest_8,,"#Person1#: Miss Chen, I'll go to America to spend my holiday. Would you please book a seat on a flight from Beijing to Washington this afternoon?
#Person2#: All right, Mr. Kinite. A telex message from London has just come in. Shall I get it for you?
#Person1#: Yes, please give it to me now. By the way, any orders today?
#Person2#: Yes. I've forwarded them to the Sales Department. Here's the telex message from London.
#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person2#: Shall I hold your business mail while you are gone or handle the letters myself?
#Person1#: Handle the letters yourself and keep them on files. But forward private mails to me two weeks before the end of my holiday.
#Person2#: I see.
#Person1#: That will be all for now. I'll call on you if I need anything else."
9,hiddentest_9,,"#Person1#: I am interested in buying auto insurance.

#Person1#: Yes, I brought everything with me.

#Person2#: Wonderful. Let's go out and check to see what shape it is in.
#Person1#: OK, can you help me figure out what I should insure my car for?
#Person2#: I will look it up on the Blue Book list and we will factor in its condition.
#Person1#: What else do I need to consider?
#Person2#: Yes, you need to figure in liability for damage to the other car as well as injury issues as well."
10,hiddentest_10,,"#Person1#: So tell me again, why couldn't you get the supplies I ordered?
#Person2#: Well I ordered them when you asked, but the supplier said they might need to back order them.
#Person1#: When do you think they will finally arrive?
#Person2#: I think maybe by Tuesday.
#Person1#: If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?
#Person2#: I could try another supplier down the street.
#Person1#: That would work for me.
#Person2#: OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going.

#Person2#: Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client."
11,hiddentest_11,,"#Person1#: What do you think about our new CEO, Matt?
#Person2#: He certainly comes with great credentials. I think he is just the man to get this company off and running.
#Person1#: The company he left in order to take this job probably regrets losing him.
#Person2#: I'm sure they do. He was the one who was supposed to assume the leadership of the company when the current president retires.
#Person1#: Do you know why he left that company?
#Person2#: Some people said he was impatient to become the CEO. Others said it was because he didn't have enough say in the company.
#Person1#: I've heard he had a lot of incentive to join our company. There is a rumor that he was given a million dollars as a bonus and an annual salary of a million dollars.
#Person2#: Yes, and he also will have an 18% share of any increase in the value of the company.
#Person1#: If the company does as well as many new high-tech companies have done recently, that could mean a lot of money in his pocket.
#Person2#: That's true. Our company hasn't started issuing stock yet. I feel certain with his leadership the stock will increase in value rapidly when it does go public.
#Person1#: That's how it's been with other companies like ours. I hope ours will be the same."

#Person2#: OK. 
#Person1#: Oh, your temperature is 39 degrees. You'd better have an injection right away.
#Person2#: I hate injections. Can I take some pills instead of injection?
#Person1#: An injection is better than pills.
#Person2#: It's up to you.
#Person1#: Here is the prescription for you.
#Person2#: Thank you. Mr. Wang. By the way, I can't sleep well recently, and I feel dizzy.
#Person1#: What do you do? Do you get a heavy load?
#Person2#: I'm the secretary of Director Nag of the Education Bureau. There is a lot of work to do every day.

#Person2#: Yes, this is where you catch the Super Shuttle. Where are you headed?
#Person1#: I am headed home to Pasadena.
#Person2#: You can tell where each van is headed by the name on the front of the van. I am the driver for Glendale, but your van should be along in a minute.
#Person1#: Do you know how much it costs to get to Pasadena?
#Person2#: I believe the cost of that trip is sixty dollars.
#Person1#: Do you know if the shuttle goes directly to Pasadena, or does it make a lot of stops?
#Person2#: Before you pay the driver, you need to ask him. He needs to be upfront with you about the number of stops he will be making.
#Person1#: Do I need to have exact change?
#Person2#: You don't need exact change, but it is useful to have smaller bills."

#Person2#: Oh, I'm ever so sorry. Managing Director. I can't tell you how sorry I am.
#Person1#: Mm what's the excuse this time?
#Person2#: Ah I just don't know what to say. I must have turned off the alarm clock and gone back to sleep. Because I worked overtime all the night.
#Person1#: Yeah, and last week one of the children wasn't well?

#Person1#: Never mind. You're always the latest one every time."
15,hiddentest_15,,"#Person1#: What kind of car insurance do you have?
#Person2#: I went with the Automobile Club.
#Person1#: Why did you choose that company?
#Person2#: I looked at the price of the type of insurance that I wanted.
#Person1#: What should I think about in choosing services?
#Person2#: There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.
#Person1#: What did you end up buying?
#Person2#: Well, my car is very old, so I didn't worry so much about what it would cost to repair it. I did buy a lot of coverage for fixing someone else's car.
#Person1#: Have you ever had to use your insurance?
#Person2#: I never had to use my insurance."

#Person1#: Tell us in detail what happened.
#Person2#: At about 5 o'clock this afternoon, I went to a small pub for dinner.
#Person1#: What's the name of the pub, and where is it?
#Person2#: Chang Jiang Jiu Jia in Chang Jiang Street, Huang Gu District.
#Person1#: Did you drink?
#Person2#: Yes. I drank 3 bottles of beer.
#Person1#: Were you drunk?
#Person2#: Yeah. It was a shame. I got tipsy and knocked a plate off the table. The plate broke into pieces.
#Person1#: Did you pay for the broken plate?
#Person2#: No. I paid only for my dinner but not for the plate.
#Person1#: Did you apologize?
#Person2#: No, I didn't. And the waiter just wouldn't let me go.
#Person1#: Why not?
#Person2#: He asked me to pay for the plate. I got mad and punched him.
#Person1#: How many times did you punch him?
#Person2#: 3 times.
#Person1#: Where did you punch him?
#Person2#: One in the mouth and the other two in the face.
#Person1#: Did he fight back?
#Person2#: No.
#Person1#: After investigation, we learned that your punches bruised the waiter's face and loosened one of his teeth.
#Person2#: I drank too much and didn't know what I was doing then.
#Person1#: You have infringed upon a citizen's rights.
#Person2#: I'm so sorry. I'd like to apologize to him and pay his medical expense.
#Person1#: That's good. You have to pay for the broken plate, too. And according to Article 22 of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Administrative Penalties for Public Security, you'll be detained for 5 days.
#Person2#: Oh! Isn't it too harsh?
#Person1#: You have the right to appeal against this ruling, of course.
#Person2#: I won't appeal. I'd rather accept it and be done with it."

#Person2#: I always buy a lot of things for my family. How about you?
#Person1#: Yes, they practically swarm me when I get home!
#Person2#: What are some of their favorite gifts?
#Person1#: The teenagers like me to bring them tee shirts that you can't get anywhere else.
#Person2#: This stuff is pretty expensive, isn't it?
#Person1#: Souvenirs cost a lot for what they are, but we can shop around for better prices.
#Person2#: Let's go across the street and see what they have over there."
18,hiddentest_18,,"#Person1#: I read that your company is downsizing again. What will that mean for your job?
#Person2#: It means I'm out of a job. They have already given me a 'pink slip'.
#Person1#: That's bad news. This has happened to you before, hasn't it?
#Person2#: Yes. This will be the third time in five years and I'm ready to call it quits.
#Person1#: What do you mean? You're going to quit working?
#Person2#: No, I'll still be working, but not for a company. I'm going to be my own boss.
#Person1#: Doesn't that make you a little nervous? You won't have all the benefits that go with working for a company no retire and no health insurance.
#Person2#: That is the bad part of it, but I am really tired of being dependent on the whims of big business. It seems that it hasn't been all that secure for me.
#Person1#: What will you do?
#Person2#: I've had a couple of friends who have gone out on their own. They say it is the best thing that ever happened to them.
#Person1#: I know it is the secret dream of a lot of people to be their own boss, especially the younger generation.
#Person2#: One of my friends just takes temporary jobs. Companies are looking for people with his skills, but only on a temporary basis. So he goes for one company to another, depending on where they need him. He's able to set his own working hours and he makes a lot more than he was when he was working full time. He really likes the freedom he enjoys.
#Person1#: What does he do when he doesn't have any jobs coming in?
#Person2#: He goes to a temporary employment agency. It seems he always finds work and doubles what he used to make.
#Person1#: I hope you find just the right thing for your skills. It would be nice to have a job that gave you more freedom.
#Person2#: That's why I'm making the change. I want to be able to spend the extra time with my family and it will be great to be working at my home instead of going to the office every day.
#Person1#: Good luck! With your attitude and ability, I'm sure you'll do well."
19,hiddentest_19,,"#Person1#: How do you plan to pack our order?
#Person2#: The standard packing. For this kind of products we export, every two dozens are packed in a paper carton, then we pack 10 cartons in one big wooden case.
#Person1#: The key issue is to make sure that the packing is seaworthy. Of the last goods we received, there were a few items damaged by dampness.
#Person2#: Yes, we've noticed that, too. But this time each wooden case is lined with plastic sheets from inside, in addition, we've put a 'keep dry' sign on the outside.
#Person1#: I guess that'll be good enough."
20,hiddentest_20,,"#Person1#: I guess that we won't be going rollerblading today with all this rain!
#Person2#: Yes, rollerblading in six inches of water would not be fun. What would you like to do instead?
#Person1#: I think that maybe we could check out the local mall, grab some lunch, and maybe see a movie.
#Person2#: Yes, that sounds like a relaxing way to check out the local culture and still stay dry.
#Person1#: What else could we do in bad weather?
#Person2#: You know, we could take a double-decker bus tour of famous haunted houses and buildings.
#Person1#: That would be fun, and the rain would only add to the atmosphere.
#Person2#: There is an old English pub next door. Maybe when we finish with the haunted house, we can duck in there for some brew.
#Person1#: What a great idea!
#Person2#: If we are lucky, maybe they'll have some great food at the pub for supper."

#Person1#: Our office is under the direct leadership of the general manager. The main task is to handle routine business, such as arranging meetings, meeting visitors, seeing visitors off, assigning work, making plans, sorting out the data and collecting information. All these affairs are very important. I'm sure you'll adapt quickly to the work here.
#Person2#: I hope so.
#Person1#: Mr. Chen, do you have anything to say about your work?
#Person2#: No. By the way, Secretary Liu, would you please tell me what the specific work is for me?
#Person1#: Sorry, I can't tell you now. After you are familiar with all these jobs, we will discuss the problem.

22,hiddentest_22,,"#Person1#: Doctor, why is it that I'm always nervous?
#Person2#: I think your condition has a lot to do with your way of work and life or habits. Now tell me Mr. Thomson. You smoke, don't you?
#Person1#: Yes. I'm afraid I do, doctor.
#Person2#: And rather heavily I imagine.
#Person1#: Yes, I smoke about forty or fifty a day.
#Person2#: Are you busy with your work?
#Person1#: Yes, very busy.
#Person2#: Did you smoke when you are at work?
#Person1#: Yes, I do.
#Person2#: You should do your best to stop.
#Person1#: I've tried to give up smoking several times, but it's no use. What can I do , doctor?
#Person2#: In my opinion, you have no choice. Either you make a real effort or there's no chance of your feeling better. You must cut it down gradually and I could prescribe some kind of tranquilizer."

24,hiddentest_24,,"#Person1#: It seems there are a growing number of new companies in the field of computers who are headed by very young people. Many of them are only in their twenties and already heading up highly successful companies.
#Person2#: That's true and I think you'll find their style of management to be very different from the traditional type of leadership.
#Person1#: I think they are more invokes in their companies. They run them as they would run a family. I believe they are more interested in their business and what it will be able to achieve for the good of the world. They don't seem to be as interested in the business as just a way to become rich as their older counterparts are.
#Person2#: Can you give me some example of their different leadership style?
#Person1#: Sure, how about this: Young bosses sometimes let their employees bring their children to work, even their pets? Many times they make decisions on the basis of what will be best for their employees instead of what is best for the business.
#Person2#: I guess young people are more idealistic, so when they have the drive and talent to start a business of their own, they also feel free to manage the business in ways that they believe are ethical and moral.
#Person1#: Do you think these young businessmen and businesswomen are more ethical and moral than business owners and managers in past generations?
#Person2#: Yes, I really do. I think businesses in the past haven't been concerned about their employees' personal needs. I think young owners have heard their parents complain about their working situations as they were growing up. Now that they can do things the way they want, they want to change things for the better.
#Person1#: Right now these young businessmen and businesswomen are making a lot of money, so it is easy for them to demonstrate their lofty ideals. Do you think they will remain true to those ideals during economic hard times?
#Person2#: I guess we'll just have to wait and see."

#Person2#: Those made of all steel have a net weight of around 17. 5 kilos and those of light aluminum alloy are about 16 kilos only.

#Person2#: In general, we have bikes for gents and ladies size 19', 21', 23', 25' and 27'. The colors vary, depending on the buyer's requirement.
#Person1#: Good. they could be marketable in our area, but such racing bicycles are new to our consumers. We must be handled very carefully right from the beginning. It's no easy thing to open up a new market.
#Person2#: We understand that there will naturally be problems in sales promotion at the initial stage. We can offer you excellent terms. So we can safely say that good quality and a reasonable price will make our bikes very competitive."

#Person2#: I don't think Walter's wife ever worked outside the home. Does she still qualify for social security?
#Person1#: Wives have the option of taking their own retirement from social security or, as in the case of Walter's wife, they just get a certain percentage of their husband's retirement.

#Person1#: I have about a thousand dollars to spend on this trip.
#Person2#: Well, take these brochures, and get back to me when you want to make your reservations."

#Person2#: Nicole, this is Richard. I think you know why I'm calling.
#Person1#: Oh, it's about the rent.
#Person2#: Yes, this is the second month in a row.
#Person1#: I thought there was a grace period.
#Person2#: There is no grace period in the rental agreement.
#Person1#: Oh, I guess I forgot.
#Person2#: Well, when can I expect the rent?
#Person1#: You'll get it by Monday.
#Person2#: Don't forget the $50 late fee.
#Person1#: Is that in the rental agreement?
#Person2#: The late fee is circled in red ink!
#Person1#: Oh, Well, I can't find my copy of the agreement.
#Person2#: If you're late next month, I might give you an eviction notice."
69,hiddentest_69,,"#Person1#: I have to apologize.
#Person2#: What happened?
#Person1#: The medical instruments you've ordered are very popular in the market these days. I'm afraid we can't give you 50 pieces at one times.
#Person2#: Then how many are available now?
#Person1#: Maybe 20 pieces?
#Person2#: Okay. But what about the 10% discount that we have agreed?
#Person1#: We can still give you 10% off as promised.
#Person2#: That's OK.
#Person1#: Then you can open the relevant letter of credit now. We'll make preparation for delivery.
#Person2#: We'll open it right now and send it through our bank.
#Person1#: We'll dispatch the goods as soon as we receive it.
#Person2#: Great!"
70,hiddentest_70,,"#Person1#: Let's discuss the delivery date first. You offered to deliver within six months after the contract signing.
#Person2#: Yes. The interval is too long, I'm afraid. Could you deliver the goods sooner?
#Person1#: I must say we can do very little in this matter. But we'd like to hear more from you on this. Then we shall see what can be done.
#Person2#: Our idea is that you deliver within three months after the contract signing.
#Person1#: Impossible! As you know, most parts of our product are produced here in our factory, but we also have some OEM parts. We have to order from them first.
#Person2#: I see. Please let us know as soon as you get them.
#Person1#: I'll certainly do that."

#Person1#: Well, Mrs. Anderson, welcome! My name's Susan Stewart, and as you know I work with your husband in the company. Do come in. Please.
#Person3#: Thank you Susan.
#Person2#: In fact, Susan is one of our brightest young women.
#Person3#: Really? Yes, think you've mentioned her to me before, actually.
#Person1#: What would you like to drink, Mrs. Anderson?
#Person3#: Er, gin tonic. With ice and lemon?

#Person3#: Oh!

#Person4#: Yes, yes. Evening classes.
#Person3#: That's right, yes. You come to French classes in evening.
#Person4#: That't right.
#Person3#: What a coincidence!
#Person4#: Yes, it's a small world, isn't it?
#Person3#: Well, George. I wonder if you've met my husband. I don't suppose you have met my husband.
#Person4#: No, I haven't. How do you do, Mr. Anderson?
#Person2#: Hello, George. Very nice to meet you."
72,hiddentest_72,,"#Person1#: Secretary Zhang, do you like traveling?
#Person2#: Yes, very much. You know, I am awfully busy as a secretary, I want badly to relax myself. Traveling is really the best way to relax.
#Person1#: Next week is the holiday. How about going sightseeing?
#Person2#: Sounds great. Have you got any idea on the tour route, Li Dan?
#Person1#: Not yet. Let's work it out together after work?
#Person2#: Good idea. Shall we go to have a cup of coffee after work?
#Person1#: How about the coffee shop next to our bureau?
#Person2#: OK."
73,hiddentest_73,,"#Person1#: What coverage will you take out for the goods I've ordered?
#Person2#: Did we conclude the business on CIF basis?
#Person1#: Yes, CIF.
#Person2#: Then we'll only insure W. P. A.
#Person1#: Could you cover the Risk of Breakage for us?
#Person2#: Risk of Breakage is classified under extraneous risk. As long as you put forward this request, we can cover the Risk of Breakage for you.
#Person1#: Who will pay the premium for it?
#Person2#: The additional premium is for buyer's account. That's for your account.
#Person1#: That's understood.
#Person2#: So, for this consignment, we shall cover W. P. A. and Risk of Breakage for 110% of the invoiced value."
74,hiddentest_74,,"#Person1#: Can we make payment by D/A?
#Person2#: I'm sorry. We generally only accept payment by D/P or irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents.
#Person1#: If that is the case, we'll have to follow your convention.
#Person2#: Thank you. And could you send us the L/C 30 days in advance? On receipt of your L/C we'll make the necessary arrangement for the shipment.

#Person2#: Thanks for helping me.
#Person1#: You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License?
#Person2#: Here is my license, it is not a very good picture of me!
#Person1#: That's a pretty good picture. Just pay the fee over at the last window and you're done!"
76,hiddentest_76,,"#Person1#: That rain is really coming down out there!
#Person2#: Yes, it's kind of crazy weather outside.
#Person1#: I get kind of nervous flying in this kind of weather.
#Person2#: I don't think anyone feels all that comfortable flying in a storm.
#Person1#: Do you think it will be this bad the whole trip?
#Person2#: On the weather channel, this storm looked to be a big one. It will probably be with us for a while.
#Person1#: I worry about too much ice on the wings.
#Person2#: I have to believe that our pilot knows what he is doing and we'll be okay.
#Person1#: When do you think the pilot will turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign?
#Person2#: He'll turn it off as soon as he knows that we are through the turbulence.
#Person1#: Do you think that we are going to crash?
#Person2#: Maybe. You just never know."

#Person1#: Here's my Driver's License and Proof of Insurance.
#Person2#: Well, just sign this card, and we'll be on our way. Don't forget to buckle your seat belt!

78,hiddentest_78,,"#Person1#: I was wondering if you could help me book a few tours.
#Person2#: You have come to the right place. How many days will you be visiting here?
#Person1#: I will be here for a week.
#Person2#: Have you ever visited our city before?
#Person1#: This is my first time visiting this city.
#Person2#: What are you interested in? Do you enjoy museums and buildings, or would you rather hit some outdoor hotspots and venues?
#Person1#: I really enjoy visiting museums and art galleries.
#Person2#: We have tours for all interests.

#Person2#: This is Rainbow Import & Export Company, Beijing. We'd like to do business with Morning Light Medical Instruments Company. Before that, we want to know about their business status.
#Person1#: Wait a minute, please. Ah, yes, ML has been our client for more that six years. It's a private company and enjoys good reputation in this area. As far as we know, it's always punctual to meet it commitments. It seems to be safe to do business with them.
#Person2#: Good. Now we can do business with them with assurance. Thank you.
#Person1#: You are welcome. Goodbye.
#Person2#: Byebye."
80,hiddentest_80,,"#Person1#: That was a good lunch. It really hit the spot. Did you enjoy yours?
#Person2#: Very good, thank you. Shall we get to the matter at hand?
#Person1#: Yes, of course. I think I have an alternative that may solve everyone's problem.
#Person2#: What's that?
#Person1#: My client believes the present installation is fine as it is but she wants to avoid expensive litigation, so in order to appease everyone, she'll move the unit to the roof at her own cost. To prevent the conduit from being visible from the street, she is willing to pay to have it penetrate the roof.
#Person2#: You know the board can't allow that. The building's documents don't give them the authority.
#Person1#: I've received the documents. I think they do.
#Person2#: I don't know how you can say that. That's a major change to the building's common area, the roof. Not only is it against the documents, it's contrary to state law.
#Person1#: Well, I don't see how you can call that a major change to the common elements. We believe it's a minor change, and that it really affects no one but my client. Therefore, it is within the board's authority to grant my client's request.
#Person2#: Well, you may be right except for one thing: penetrating the roof will compromise its integrity, and that is a major issue. That definitely moves it beyond the scope of board's authority."

#Person2#: Hello, Sue.
#Person1#: Hey, it's really nice of you to come. I wasn't sure that you'd be able to.

#Person2#: Oh, thanks very much. I can't stay long, I'm afraid. But I hope that's all right.
#Person1#: Yeah, any problem?
#Person2#: Well, no. It's just that I've got to meet someone later on.

84,hiddentest_84,,"#Person1#: We've considered your price and thought it acceptable.
#Person2#: That's good. Then how many do you want?
#Person1#: Can we just place a small order first? If they do sell well, we'll come back for more orders.
#Person2#: That's all right. But I'd like to tell you that this kind of product represents the development trend in the next decade. Even in the United States, there are only a couple of manufacturers who can make it. And don't forget the 10% off if you buy 50 pieces.
#Person1#: In that case, we'll order 50 of it.
#Person2#: That's good. Then shall we sign the agreement now?
#Person1#: OK."
85,hiddentest_85,,"#Person1#: What can I do for you?
#Person2#: I came to you for advice on how to promote trade with China and other Asian countries?
#Person1#: You are most welcome.
#Person2#: The Chinese government seems to offer much encouragement to developing various flexible forms of trade. An idea came upon me while visiting the World Fair that I should adopt one of those forms to get inside the mainland territory. What would you suggest that I should do for our saloon car exports to Asia?
#Person1#: Why don't you take advantage of the cheaper labour and the preferential polices in the Chinese coastal areas?
#Person2#: In what way, please?
#Person1#: You can produce the saloon car in China and sell them there and to other Asian countries. This can be done either on the basis of export processing or compensation trade.
#Person2#: Hm I think the compensation trade arrangements suit me fine. Thank you very much for information."
86,hiddentest_86,,"#Person1#: I just arrived and need help getting transportation to my hotel.
#Person2#: There are shuttles, taxis, and buses that go all over the city.
#Person1#: Which one is the best form of transportation?
#Person2#: It depends on where you want to go. If you are going to a well-known hotel, they have their own shuttles that drop you right off at the door.
#Person1#: Where can I catch a cab?
#Person2#: All ground transportation leaves from the island as you walk out the arrivals gate.
#Person1#: Where can I rent a car?
#Person2#: The car rental agencies are against the wall as you exit.

#Person1#: Yeah, I saw it.

#Person1#: The best way is to go to a website like Travelocity or Expedia. They can help you find the best price.
#Person2#: What information do I need to provide to book a flight?
#Person1#: You need to know where you are going and when you want to travel.
#Person2#: How do I get the cheapest rate?
#Person1#: Usually you get the best price by having some flexibility in your travel time and dates.

#Person1#: No, up against the wall is just fine.
#Person2#: Where would you like this table?

#Person1#: Thanks.
#Person2#: I hope after the first supply your customers will place regular orders.
#Person1#: For regular orders, couldn't you agree to payment by L/C at 90 day's sight?
#Person2#: I am afraid not. Our usual practice is L/C at sight.

#Person2#: I don't know where exactly to get a loan.
#Person1#: Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.
#Person2#: What is the best choice for financing?
#Person1#: It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.
#Person2#: What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?
#Person1#: You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good luck!"
