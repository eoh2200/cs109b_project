Roseanne: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen.
Vince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away.
Kyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust.
Megan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P
Roseanne: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty.
Vince: What's the difference?
Roseanne: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around.

Megan: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D
Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.
Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D
Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.
Kyle: Do they pay him? :P
Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?
Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.
Roseanne: The famous chocolate cookies?
Megan: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D

Max: Yeah, I'm trying to convince her to get a licence, too. I don't want her to feel like I'm only doing this for myself. It would be better if both of us could drive."

Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to
Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence
Chris: had no idea about the second one
Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse
Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again
Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that
Emily: true
Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;)
Oliver: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote
Chris: makes sense
Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import
Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings

Chris: right
Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again

Sally: I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back
Fran: You probably started thinking too much ;)
Sally: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy
Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;)
Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all
Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;)
Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk
Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once
Sally: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all
Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything. 
Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things
Fran: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;)
Sally: You're probably right."

Jessie is not sure, but might help with the paperwork. Steve is oppose to the idea. Michaela, Jessie, Steve and Ron will discuss it in person on Monday. ","Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea?
Ron: I might be lacking the context here
Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example
Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork.
Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year.
Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.
Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility
Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?
Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.
Jessie: so what do we get from it really?
Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.
Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>
Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association
Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually
Michaela: I recall two as well
Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.
Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours
Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding
Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association
Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work
Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly
Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it
Michaela: Steve?
Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now

Luisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.
Leu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.

They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.
Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?
Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!

Leu: Therapy?
Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.
Leu: Nor can I.
Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.
Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.
Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...

734,13716430,Max and his friends watched the video about cannabis. Allen believes that long term use has no consequences according to the research. Jeremy explains it wasn't long term use but rather an occasional use. Mark reckons they don't affect the lungs. Virginia thinks MJ users won't believe anything bad.,"Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video? 
Max: <link_video>
Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.
Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an ""occasional low cumulative"", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.
Max: Tom You didn’t watch the video.
Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)
Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well.
Daniel: Short attention span 😊
Max: Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️
Max: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other. 
David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco.
Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???
Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?
David: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...
Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.
Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine
Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.
Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.
Mark: Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!!

Jill: To help with the household?
Doris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.
Jill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?
Doris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally. She's strong but her body may need a rest. We'll see!
Jill: I'll keep fingers crossed for you! Both of you.

#Person1#: It shouldn't, this is just a fun project to help you get more interested in the lessons. There is a more serious side to it, though. I want you to write a one page essay about the videos and tell the class about your project on Friday. You can show some of the videos during your presentation too if you like. I think the whole class will benefit from this.

#Person2#: For my part, xiangqi. Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese.
#Person1#: I think chess is more reasonable. You see, each side has eight pawns, a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi. A true battle should be like that. Soldiers should outnumber the commanders.
#Person2#: Quite right. And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi, the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank. It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance.
#Person1#: Correct! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king. It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent. They are required to stay in the palace, waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards. Look at the king in chess, he is much more capable.
#Person2#: Yeah, and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards, he has a queen who is the most powerful piece. I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China.
#Person1#: There's another distinctive contrast. Both board games use a total of 32 pieces, but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board, bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess.
#Person2#: You mean, xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around?
#Person1#: Sure. On a chessboard, fire is much more intensive. It has a smaller board, while those bigger pieces-chariots, horses and bishops-can cover longer distances."

Our guest is Jennifer Benzes. Thank you for coming, Jennifer. Do you mind saying something about your divorce?

#Person1#: Have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? Their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re-establish their lives.
#Person2#: Of course, we have. We are definitely more aware of the impact on children. After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children.
#Person1#: How?
#Person2#: We tell them we love them and will always do.
#Person1#: You haven't thought of saving the marriage?
#Person2#: Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer.
#Person1#: Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it.
#Person2#: It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing.
#Person1#: Yet most people believe a hard marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think?
#Person2#: I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarreling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children.
#Person1#: What do you want society to do for you?
#Person2#: Understand us, not curse us. More importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future."

#Person2#: Haven't been sleeping well recently.
#Person1#: What's the problem?
#Person2#: Every night my roommates watch the Korean soap operas till mid-night. I am not a big fan of Korean shows and I don't know how to tell them to stop without hurting their feelings.
#Person1#: Well, you can simply tell them you want to sleep, or make an agreement for a time when the room should quiet down.
#Person2#: Yeah, I know, but I find these sorts of things hard to say. They won't like it if I tell them to turn off the TV. Now I just hope the show will end soon.
#Person1#: I understand. I used to live in a dorm with four people. I was great in some aspects. We always went out and and had fun together. But on the other hand, when I wanted some quiet time, and people kept talking and laughing aloud, it was torturous. For me a room to myself, even a small one, is ideal. Though I don't mind sharing an apartment with somebody.
#Person2#: Yeah, I crave my own space. I just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time. We all need our private space. But I also think interpersonal skills very important. Living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others, otherwise nobody is going to have a good time."

#Person2#: Well, the universe is a chaotic place, and the gravity from one galaxy, or from a group of galaxies, may disturb the motion of its near neighbors, causing them to collide. However, on average, when you compare two large enough chunks of space, the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other.

For a closer look at what's happening, we turn to Lisa Lynch, an economics professor at Tofts University. Lisa Lynch, when you look at these numbers, do you think job creation is on the rise?
#Person2#: It certainly is. It was a great report. It indicates that the job market, broadly speaking, has turned the corner after 3 very long, lean years. I think we are going to see improvement. It's not only the March gain. It was gain in January and February. They were both revised higher, and moreover, the job gains were very broadly-based across many industries. It was a very positive report.
#Person1#: What do you see in the numbers? Who's getting the new jobs?
#Person2#: As I mentioned, when we looked at the numbers, 'we are seeing employment across the board in all sectors, with one important exception, and that's in manufacturing. Well, we do not have any job loss in manufacturing sector for the first time in 44 months. We did not see pick up in the manufacturing sector, but we saw restaurant and hotel workers being added on. We saw workers in supermarket being added on. Part of that reflects the settlement of the grocery stores strike out California. We saw workers in the health care sector and hospitals being added on. We saw business services adding employees. So in general, with the very important exception of manufacturing, we are seeing job growth across all of these different types of occupations."

#Person2#: That's great! I like this style very much. And I think if you want to embody the Chinese elements, you should use the red color. It is the most representative color in China, and sometimes it is called 'Chinese Red'.
#Person1#: Oh, yes, I agree with you. And as for the door and the windows, I also like to use lattice. I think it is the most important elements of Chinese decorating.
#Person2#: Yes. I think you have a good understanding of the Chinese style. And I suggest you'd better hang two Chinese landscape paintings.
#Person1#: Oh. That's a good idea. I will buy them in the afternoon. And I'd like to paint the walls again and buy a new sofa.
#Person2#: What color do you want to paint?
#Person1#: I don't know exactly, but I'd like to use fresh colors. I think these colors look vivid.
#Person2#: What about the sofa?
#Person1#: I have no idea about it."

#Person2#: No, but I can't stand him anymore. He is the worst roommate I've ever had. He never cleans up after himself and he is always listening to loud music when I try to get some sleep.
#Person1#: Why don't you have a heart-to-heart talk with him?
#Person2#: I've tried, but it didn't work. Maybe you can talk to him. After all, you are his good friend."

#Person2#: No, I haven't. I'm so surprised at the news. 
#Person1#: Indeed, we got married too soon. 
#Person2#: Congratulations. But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time? 
#Person1#: Yes. However, I believe that marriage comes by destiny. I knew I would marry Julia when I met her at the first time. 
#Person2#: How's your married life? 
#Person1#: We're happy together now. 
#Person2#: I have to say you're a well-matched couple. 
#Person1#: Thank you! "

It's got its own library, theatre, swimming pool, and a guest house. #Person1# doesn't want to live there because it's too big to take care of by one person. #Person1# prefers old cottages in a quiet village in England because they've got characters.","#Person1#: Have you ever seen Bill Gate's home on the internet? 
#Person2#: No. what's it like? 
#Person1#: It's got its own library, theatre, swimming pool, and a guest house. The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through a remote control. It's also located near the sea, so he can park his boats next to his house. It's absolutely amazing! 
#Person2#: Would you want to live there? 
#Person1#: I think his house is fantastic, but I wouldn't want to live there. You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house, plus a few people to take care of the gardens, and probably an au pair or two to take care of the children. It's just too big of a place to take care of on your own. 
#Person2#: What's your dreamhome like then? 
#Person1#: My dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quiet village in England.
#Person2#: Would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself? 
#Person1#: Old homes are great because they've got character. I think that's important. 
#Person2#: Is that why you wear second-hand clothes as well? Because they've got character? 
#Person1#: No, that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time! 
#Person2#: I see. If you lived in an old house, would it be decorated in a modern way? 
#Person1#: No, I'd definitely try to restore it to its original state. I love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more! "

He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments. This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment. 
#Person2#: What happened? Did your boss say something to offend you at work? 
#Person1#: He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out, referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling. I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment. 
#Person2#: Don't you think you are overreacting a little? Calling you by nicknames shouldn't be so bad... 
#Person1#: You're missing the point. It's about respect. He treats us with such a patronizing attitude, as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers. It's his attitude that needs to be changed, not just his words. 
#Person2#: That's what you get for working in a male-dominated field. I think you'll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way. You probably won't be able to change him. "
